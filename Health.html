                <p>Losing weight reduces the risk of diabetes. People in one large study reduced their risk of
                    developing diabetes by almost 60% after losing approximately 7% of their body weight with changes in
                    exercise and diet. The American Diabetes Association
                    recommends that people with prediabetes lose at least 7% to 10% of their body weight to prevent
                    disease progression. More weight loss will translate into even greater benefits.Set a
                    weight-loss goal based on your current body weight. Talk to your doctor about reasonable
                    short-term goals and expectations, such as a losing 1 to 2 pounds a week.</p>

                <p>Combining a healthy diet with regular exercise is the best way of maintaining a healthy weight.
                    Having a healthy weight reduces your chances of developing high blood pressure.<br>Regular exercise
                    will make your heart and blood circulatory system more efficient, lower your cholesterol level, and
                    also keep your blood pressure at a healthy level.<br>Exercising regularly reduces your risk of
                    having a heart attack. The heart is a muscle and, like any other muscle, benefits from exercise. A
                    strong heart can pump more blood around your body with less effort.<br>Any aerobic exercise, such as
                    walking, swimming and dancing, makes your heart work harder and keeps it healthy.</p>

                        <li>7 Tips to Avoid Stress</li>
                    </b></h4>
                <p>There are emotional and behavioral consequences of stress that can make it difficult to perform your
                    daily routine. These include anxiety, depression, fatigue, becoming aggressive, unmotivated, or
                    withdrawn, and difficulties with problem-solving and concentration. There are also physiological
                    consequences of stress including headaches, nausea, and palpitations.
                    So, how can you avoid stress and assuage the negative social, emotional and physical consequences of
                    it in the process?
                    Here are some tips:

                    <li>Take care of yourself.</li>
                    Avoid drugs and alcohol as they can add to stress. Eat a well-balanced diet, get enough sleep, and
                    exercise on a regular basis.<br>
                    <li>Engage in self-relaxation.</li>
                    Try muscle relaxation, breathing or meditation exercises, prayer, yoga, or swimming to reduce
                    stress. Spend time with nature or listen to quiet music.<br>
                    <li>Take breaks when needed.</li>
                    Especially at work, taking breaks can help you re-organize and re-energize your thoughts and focus.
                    This will help you do your work and maintain productivity.<br>
                    <li>Seek out social support.</li>
                    A partner, family member, friend, counselor, doctor, or clergyperson can help lighten your mental
                    load.<br>
                    <li>Connect with others socially.</li>
                    Spending time with loved ones and doing fun things can help ease the stress.<br>
                    <li>Maintain a normal routine.</li>
                    Get up in the morning and go to bed at night each day at the same time. Eat three meals daily.<br>
                    <li>Give back to others.</li>
                    Sometimes channeling your energy into giving like doing community service or helping a neighbor or a
                    friend can channel your energy in positive ways.
